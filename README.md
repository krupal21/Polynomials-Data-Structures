# Polynomials-Data-Structures

Using linked list to do various operations with polynomials in Java. Project at Rutgers University-New Brunswick for Sesh Venugopal in CS112 Data Structures.

Input a text file into the program 
'''
Select [1] for ADD, [2] for MULTIPLY, [3] for EVALUATE, and [4] for EXIT. 
'''
Then, input a second text file and obtain a result. The text files simply have numbers that will later be converted into a linked list with coefficients and degrees of the polynomial in descending order.

OBJECTIVE


Read the text file and create a linked list version of the polynomial. Write code for all operations of polynoimals and return a polynomial or value. Add and Subtract will return polynomials while evaluate will take in a number and evaluate the polynomial at a certain integer and return an integer. Test each operation throughly and utilize the text files given, but also create new ones to ensure every case is handled.
